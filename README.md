# OPDS Page Streaming Extension

## What is it?

The OPDS Page Streaming Extension (OPDS-PSE) is an **_unofficial_** extension of the [Open Distribution Publication System](https://specs.opds.io/opds-1.2). Its goal is to enrich the OPDS feed with information allowing the client to request a specific page of a document without having to download it completely.

This extension was designed primarily for comic books, to allow reading them on connected devices without having to wait for the book to be completely downloaded.

## Why this repo?

In order to add more features to the OPDS PSE 1.0 specification, we created this repository to host the source of the specification, open for everyone to discuss and contribute.

The original 1.0 specification has been created by Tom for Ubooquity, and can be found
